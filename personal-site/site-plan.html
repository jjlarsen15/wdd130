      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p><strong>Website Overview</strong><br>My website will be a fan-made resource hub dedicated to the Star Wars universe. The focus of the site will be to provide organized, easy-to-read information about the characters, locations, and plots of each Star Wars movie. The primary audience includes both longtime fans looking to refresh their memory and newcomers to the franchise who want a quick and reliable way to get up to speed. This site will serve as a central guide for anyone curious about the movies, needing context for a character, or simply wanting to explore the galaxy far, far away.</p>

      <p><strong>Simple Summaries</strong><br>Another feature of the website will be short, spoiler-aware synopses of each film. The goal is to give readers a clear sense of what happens in each movie without overwhelming them with too much detail or ruining key plot points if they haven’t seen the movie yet. These synopses will include the main conflicts, setting, and character arcs while avoiding overly technical descriptions. This approach makes it helpful for both casual viewers and dedicated fans looking for a refresher.</p>

      <p><strong>Location Highlights</strong><br>In addition to characters and synopses, I will also include a section for notable locations introduced in each movie. Star Wars is known for its rich worldbuilding, and planets like Tatooine, Coruscant, Hoth, and Mustafar are central to the story. Each location page will give a brief history, note any major events that took place there, and explain its relevance to the larger saga. This helps users understand the world of Star Wars on a deeper level without having to dive into long-winded articles or complicated lore breakdowns.</p>

      <p><strong>Audience Purpose</strong><br>Visitors will expect the site to answer questions such as: “Who is that character?” “What happens in this movie?” “Where is this scene set?” and “What movie did this location or character first appear in?” My site is designed to provide these answers quickly and clearly, without the need to scroll through long pages or read unrelated material. Each section will be clean, searchable, and divided by movie, with tags and filters for easy browsing.</p>

      <p><strong>User Activities</strong><br>Visitors might want to use the site while watching the movies, when they pause to say, “Wait, who is that?” or “Have we seen that planet before?” Others might use it to help write fan fiction or prepare for a rewatch marathon. The site will also be helpful to parents introducing their kids to Star Wars and looking for age-appropriate summaries of the films.</p>

      <p><strong>Site Advantage</strong><br>What makes my site different from other Star Wars websites is the clean organization and movie-by-movie breakdown. Most other fan sites are encyclopedic, which can be overwhelming for someone just looking for a quick answer or refresher. By focusing on one movie at a time and keeping entries short and clear, my site becomes more user-friendly and inviting, especially for casual fans or those who don’t want to fall into a rabbit hole of information.<p>

      <h3>Characters & Locations</h3>
      <p><strong>Character Descriptions</strong><br>Each Star Wars movie introduces a cast of memorable characters, and this section provides short bios for the most important ones. You’ll find key information like their role in the movie, alliances (Jedi, Sith, Rebels, Empire, etc.), and major actions that define their character arc. For example, Luke Skywalker’s journey from a farm boy to a Jedi hero will be summarized in just a few lines, ideal for anyone needing a quick refresher.</p>

      <p><strong>Notable Planets & Locations</strong><br>Star Wars is famous for its diverse settings—from the desert planet of Tatooine to the icy Hoth and the city-covered Coruscant. This section gives readers a quick overview of each important location featured in the first six films. Each planet or setting includes a short summary of its role in the story, key events that happened there, and the characters who visited. This helps users visually and narratively place each location in the Star Wars timeline.</p>

      <h3>Movie Synopses</h3>
      <p><strong>Movie Summaries</strong><br>Each of the six movies will have its own short summary, focusing on the key plot points, major conflicts, and important characters. These recaps are written with spoilers in mind—they won’t ruin major twists but will give readers a clear sense of what happens. For example, “Episode I: The Phantom Menace” will focus on the rise of Anakin Skywalker, the return of the Sith, and the political intrigue that sets the stage for the Clone Wars.</p>

      <p><strong>Tone & Themes</strong><br>Each film summary will also include a quick note on its tone and core themes—such as hope, betrayal, identity, or redemption. This gives viewers deeper context and helps them connect emotionally to the story. Whether you’re preparing for a rewatch or explaining the saga to a friend, this section will make the narrative easier to follow and enjoy.</p>
