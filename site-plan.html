      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p><strong>Website Overview</strong><br>My website will be a resource hub dedicated to the Star Wars universe. The focus of the site will be to provide organized, easy-to-read information about the characters, locations, and plots of each Star Wars movie.</p>

      <p><strong>Simple Summaries</strong><br>Another feature of the website will be short, spoiler-aware synopses of each film. The goal is to give readers a clear sense of what happens in each movie without overwhelming them with too much detail.</p>

      <p><strong>Location Highlights</strong><br>In addition to characters and synopses, I will also include a section for notable locations introduced in each movie. Each location page will give a brief history and explain its relevance to the larger saga.</p>

      <p><strong>Audience Purpose</strong><br>Visitors can expect the site to answer questions such as: “Who is that character?” “What happens in this movie?” “Where is this scene set?” The site provides these answers clearly and efficiently.</p>

      <p><strong>User Activities</strong><br>Visitors might want to use the site while watching the movies, during fan fiction writing, or while prepping for a rewatch marathon. It’s also helpful to parents introducing Star Wars to kids.</p>

      <p><strong>Site Advantage</strong><br>What makes my site different from other Star Wars websites is the clean organization and movie-by-movie breakdown. It’s user-friendly and ideal for quick reference.</p>
